This is a start of model for a nonprofit social media site. 

This is meant to become the Netflix of social media. 

This site is meant to replace Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram. Maybe more later. 

This site might have self serve advertising. Users could pay a small fee to not see advertising. 

Profits could be donated to charities voted upon by the user base, and reinvested in the development of new features. 

Please contribute to, watch, star, and fork this project as necessary. Thank you!

Would it be better if this were setup as a benefit corporation?
